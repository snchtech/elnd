In Oracle Database version 10.2, you can generate a random key of length 6 to 10 symbols using a combination of the `DBMS_RANDOM` package and the `SUBSTR` function. Here is an example SQL query that you can use to generate a random key:

sql
SELECT SUBSTR(DBMS_RANDOM.STRING('X', FLOOR(DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE(6, 11))), 1, 10) AS random_key
FROM dual;


In this query:
- `DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE(6, 11)` generates a random number between 6 and 10 (inclusive) to determine the length of the key.
- `DBMS_RANDOM.STRING('X', length)` generates a random string of the specified length using characters from the specified character set ('X' in this case).
- `SUBSTR(string, start_position, length)` extracts a substring of the generated random string to ensure it is between 6 and 10 symbols long.

You can run this query in Oracle Database version 10.2 to generate a random key of varying lengths between 6 and 10 symbols.
