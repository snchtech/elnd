To encode a key in a return value and then decode it in Apex, Node.js, and PHP, you can use a common encoding/decoding algorithm such as Base64. Here's how you can achieve this in each of the mentioned languages:

1. Encoding in JavaScript (Node.js):
javascript
const key = 'your_key_to_encode';
const encodedKey = Buffer.from(key).toString('base64');
console.log(encodedKey);


2. Decoding in Apex (Salesforce):
apex
String encodedKey = 'your_encoded_key';
Blob decodedBlob = EncodingUtil.base64Decode(encodedKey);
String decodedKey = decodedBlob.toString();
System.debug(decodedKey);


3. Decoding in PHP:
php
$encodedKey = 'your_encoded_key';
$decodedKey = base64_decode($encodedKey);
echo $decodedKey;


By using Base64 encoding, you can encode the key in one language and decode it in another language seamlessly. Make sure to handle any encoding/decoding errors and ensure that the encoded key is transmitted securely if it contains sensitive information.
