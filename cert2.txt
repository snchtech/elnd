1. Convert P7B to PEM:
Use the following OpenSSL command to convert the P7B certificate to a PEM format:

   openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in your_cert.p7b -out your_cert.pem
   


2. Extract Private Key and Certificate:
Once you have the PEM file, you will need to extract the private key and certificate from it. You can do this manually by opening the PEM file in a text editor and copying the private key and certificate sections into separate files.

3. Update Node.js Code:
Modify the Node.js code snippet to include the paths to the private key, certificate, and intermediate certificate (if applicable) that you extracted from the PEM file:
javascript
   const https = require('https');
   const fs = require('fs');

   const options = {
     key: fs.readFileSync('path_to_private_key.pem'),
     cert: fs.readFileSync('path_to_certificate.pem'),
     ca: fs.readFileSync('path_to_intermediate_certificate.pem') // Include this line if you have an intermediate certificate
   };

   https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
     // Your Node.js app logic here
   }).listen(443);
   


4. Restart Node.js App:
Restart your Node.js app to apply the changes and start serving over HTTPS using the P7B certificate converted to PEM format.
