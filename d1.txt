1. Initialize an empty object to serve as the root of your tree structure:
const tree = {};

2. Iterate through each item in the JSON array using a loop or the `forEach` method:
  
   jsonData.forEach(item => {
     // Logic to build the tree structure
   });

3. For each item, extract the different levels (first, second, and third) using array destructuring:
   

   const [first, second, third] = item;
   

4. Check if the first level already exists in the tree. If not, create an empty object for it:
   

   if (!tree[first]) {
     tree[first] = {};
   }

5. Repeat the same check for the second level, creating an empty object if needed:
   

   if (!tree[first][second]) {
     tree[first][second] = {};
   }


6. Finally, assign the third item/link to the corresponding location in the tree:
   

   tree[first][second] = third;
