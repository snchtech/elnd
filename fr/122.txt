The solution can work on Oracle 12.1 with minor adjustments. Oracle 12.1 has limited support for JSON features compared to later versions, so you need to adapt the PL/SQL code to handle JSON generation manually if native JSON functions are not available.

Hereâ€™s how to modify the solution to be compatible with Oracle 12.1:

---

### Adjustments for Oracle 12.1

#### 1. **Generate JSON Without Native JSON Functions:**
Oracle 12.1 does not support `JSON_OBJECT`. You can build the JSON manually using concatenation in PL/SQL.

```sql
DECLARE
    l_json CLOB;
BEGIN
    l_json := '['; -- Start JSON array

    FOR r IN (
        SELECT id_app, order_app
          FROM your_table
         WHERE username = :APP_USER
    ) LOOP
        -- Append JSON object
        l_json := l_json || '{' ||
                  '"id_app":' || r.id_app || ',' ||
                  '"order_app":' || r.order_app ||
                  '},';
    END LOOP;

    -- Remove the trailing comma and close the JSON array
    IF l_json LIKE '%},' THEN
        l_json := SUBSTR(l_json, 1, LENGTH(l_json) - 1);
    END IF;
    l_json := l_json || ']';

    -- Output the JSON
    HTP.prn(l_json);
END;
```

This PL/SQL block generates JSON as a string, which is compatible with Oracle 12.1.

#### 2. **JavaScript Remains Unchanged:**
The JavaScript provided in the original solution remains the same, as it fetches the JSON data from the AJAX callback and processes it.

---

#### 3. **Ensure `li` Tags Have Classes:**
Make sure your Oracle APEX Cards region dynamically sets classes for `li` tags based on the `id_app`. You can use the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT id_app,
       order_app,
       username,
       'app-id-' || id_app AS class_attribute
  FROM your_table
 WHERE username = :APP_USER
```

Bind the `class_attribute` column to the `li` tag's `class` attribute in the Cards region template.

---

#### 4. **Set Up the AJAX Callback in Oracle APEX:**
- Create a new **AJAX Callback** process in the page where the Cards region is displayed.
- Paste the modified PL/SQL code above into the process.

---

### Summary of Adjustments:
1. Replace `JSON_OBJECT` with manual JSON string construction in PL/SQL.
2. Ensure that Oracle APEX generates the required `class` attributes for your `li` tags.
3. Keep the JavaScript logic unchanged.

This approach ensures compatibility with Oracle 12.1 while maintaining the desired functionality.
