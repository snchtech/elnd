1. Create a new select list item in your Oracle APEX application.

2. Set the List of Values Source of the select list item to "SQL Query."

3. Use the following SQL query to populate the select list with role names and role IDs without the "p_" construction for a specific app_id (e.g., 25):

sql
SELECT role_name AS display_value,
       TO_NUMBER(REGEXP_REPLACE(role_id, '[^0-9]', '')) AS return_value
FROM your_table_name
WHERE app_id = :P25_APP_ID
