You want to filter records in Oracle SQL based on two conditions:

1. Records from **today** (i.e., current date).
2. Or records from **yesterday after 17:00 (5 PM)** **and** where `action = 'login'`.

Here’s how you can write the `WHERE` clause for that logic in Oracle SQL:

```sql
WHERE 
    TRUNC("date") = TRUNC(SYSDATE) -- today's records
    OR (
        "date" >= TRUNC(SYSDATE - 1) + INTERVAL '17' HOUR
        AND "date" < TRUNC(SYSDATE) -- ensure it's still before today
        AND action = 'login'
    )
```

### Explanation:

* `TRUNC("date") = TRUNC(SYSDATE)` → gets all records from **today** (midnight onwards).
* `TRUNC(SYSDATE - 1)` → gives **yesterday at 00:00**.
* `+ INTERVAL '17' HOUR` → adds 17 hours, so it becomes **yesterday at 17:00 (5 PM)**.
* `"date" < TRUNC(SYSDATE)` ensures that we only take times before today (i.e., still yesterday).
* `action = 'login'` restricts to login actions for the second case.

### Full Query Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE 
    TRUNC("date") = TRUNC(SYSDATE)
    OR (
        "date" >= TRUNC(SYSDATE - 1) + INTERVAL '17' HOUR
        AND "date" < TRUNC(SYSDATE)
        AND action = 'login'
    );
```

Let me know if your `date` column includes a time component, or if you use a different data type.
