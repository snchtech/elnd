If you use a **Before Header Process** on Page 1, its purpose is to initialize the `P0_DEPARTMENT` item when the page is first loaded. Since `P0_DEPARTMENT` is a global page item, setting its value here ensures that the region on the global page is provided with a value before it attempts to render data.

### Steps to Create a **Before Header Process**:
1. Go to **Page Designer** for Page 1.
2. In the **Processing** section, click **Add Process**.
3. Configure the process:
   - **Name**: Set `P0_DEPARTMENT Initialization`.
   - **Point**: `Before Header`.
   - **Type**: `PL/SQL Code`.
   - **Code**:
     ```sql
     :P0_DEPARTMENT := 234; -- Replace 234 with the value you want to set
     ```
   - **Condition**: Use this if the process should only run under certain circumstances, for example:
     - **Condition Type**: `Item is Null`.
     - **Item**: `P0_DEPARTMENT`.

4. Save and Run Page 1.

### Why Use a Before Header Process?
The **Before Header Process** runs before the page rendering begins. By setting `P0_DEPARTMENT` here:
- It ensures the value is available for the Cards region on the global page before rendering.
- The Cards region query can use `:P0_DEPARTMENT` without getting null data.

### Ensuring Region Refresh:
After setting `P0_DEPARTMENT` in the Before Header Process:
- If `P0_DEPARTMENT` is used as a bind variable in the Cards region SQL query, the region will load with this value when the page is loaded.
- If you dynamically update `P0_DEPARTMENT` later, use the dynamic action described earlier to refresh the region.
