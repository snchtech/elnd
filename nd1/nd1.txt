To achieve this functionality in your Oracle APEX interactive report, you can use a computed column in SQL that dynamically calculates the "status" based on the current time (`SYSDATE`) and the shift intervals. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Define the Shift Time Intervals**:
   You have three shifts:
   - Shift 1: 07:00 - 15:00
   - Shift 2: 15:00 - 23:00
   - Shift 3: 23:00 - 07:00

   Based on `SYSDATE`, you will check whether `start_done` or `end_done` is null and if the `start_date` or `end_date` falls within the current shift.

2. **Create a CASE Statement**:
   You can use a `CASE` statement in your SQL query to create a computed column for "status."

Here's an example SQL query that you can integrate into your interactive report:

```sql
SELECT id, name, department, start_date, start_done, end_date, end_done,
  CASE
    WHEN start_done IS NULL 
      AND TO_CHAR(start_date, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN 
          CASE 
            WHEN TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN '07:00' AND '15:00' THEN '07:00'
            WHEN TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN '15:00' AND '23:00' THEN '15:00'
            ELSE '23:00'
          END 
          AND 
          CASE 
            WHEN TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN '07:00' AND '15:00' THEN '15:00'
            WHEN TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN '15:00' AND '23:00' THEN '23:00'
            ELSE '07:00'
          END THEN 1
    WHEN end_done IS NULL 
      AND TO_CHAR(end_date, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN 
          CASE 
            WHEN TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN '07:00' AND '15:00' THEN '07:00'
            WHEN TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN '15:00' AND '23:00' THEN '15:00'
            ELSE '23:00'
          END 
          AND 
          CASE 
            WHEN TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN '07:00' AND '15:00' THEN '15:00'
            WHEN TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'HH24:MI') BETWEEN '15:00' AND '23:00' THEN '23:00'
            ELSE '07:00'
          END THEN 2
    ELSE 0
  END AS status
FROM your_table;
```

### Explanation:
- **Shift Identification**: Based on `SYSDATE`, the query identifies which shift the current time falls into. 
- **Start and End Date Comparison**: The `TO_CHAR` function converts the times to 'HH24:MI' format, which allows for the comparison of the `start_date` and `end_date` with the current shift interval.
- **Status Assignment**:
  - If `start_done` is null and `start_date` falls within the current shift, `status` is set to `1`.
  - If `end_done` is null and `end_date` falls within the current shift, `status` is set to `2`.
  - Otherwise, `status` is set to `0`.

You can now add this computed column to your Oracle APEX interactive report to reflect the shift-based statuses in real time.
