Yes, in a Next.js application, the page will re-render whenever the component state or props are updated. However, re-renders shouldn't inherently cause a "flashing" effect in the canvas area unless the canvas itself is being unmounted and remounted or reinitialized, which can happen if:

1. **The `Stage` Component Is Recreated:**
   If the `Stage` or `Layer` components are being re-created during each render, this can cause the flashing effect because the DOM elements (the canvas) are effectively replaced.

2. **State Updates Are Inefficient:**
   If you are updating the state in a way that causes unnecessary re-renders of the entire `Stage`, this can lead to performance issues.

---

### **Why Flashing Happens in Your Code**
In your current code, each time you call `setShapes` in `handleDragEnd`, the entire `Stage` and its children (`Layer`, `Rect`, etc.) are being re-rendered because React processes state updates and re-renders components accordingly.

---

### **How to Fix Flashing**
#### **1. Prevent Re-Creation of `Stage` or `Layer`**
Ensure that `Stage` and `Layer` are not re-created on every render by using `React.memo` to memoize these components.

For example:

```javascript
import React, { memo } from 'react';

// Memoize Layer and its children
const MemoizedLayer = memo(({ shapes, handleDragEnd }) => (
  <Layer>
    {shapes.map((shape) =>
      shape.type === 'rect' ? (
        <Rect
          key={shape.id}
          x={shape.x}
          y={shape.y}
          width={shape.width}
          height={shape.height}
          fill={shape.fill}
          draggable
          onDragEnd={(e) => handleDragEnd(shape.id, e)}
        />
      ) : (
        <Circle
          key={shape.id}
          x={shape.x}
          y={shape.y}
          radius={shape.radius}
          fill={shape.fill}
          draggable
          onDragEnd={(e) => handleDragEnd(shape.id, e)}
        />
      )
    )}
  </Layer>
));
```

Use this `MemoizedLayer` instead of directly rendering a `Layer` in your `Stage`.

---

#### **2. Avoid Re-Rendering the Entire Canvas**
Only update the specific shape that was dragged. This minimizes updates to the canvas.

```javascript
const handleDragEnd = (id, e) => {
  setShapes((prevShapes) =>
    prevShapes.map((shape) =>
      shape.id === id ? { ...shape, x: e.target.x(), y: e.target.y() } : shape
    )
  );
};
```

This way, only the shape that was dragged is updated in the state, and React will re-render only that shape.

---

#### **3. Use Stable Props**
Ensure props passed to `Stage`, `Layer`, and `Rect`/`Circle` are stable by memoizing them with `useMemo`.

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  const stableShapes = useMemo(() => shapes, [shapes]);

  return (
    <Stage ref={stageRef} width={window.innerWidth} height={window.innerHeight}>
      <Layer>
        {stableShapes.map((shape) => {
          if (shape.type === 'rect') {
            return (
              <Rect
                key={shape.id}
                x={shape.x}
                y={shape.y}
                width={shape.width}
                height={shape.height}
                fill={shape.fill}
                draggable
                onDragEnd={(e) => handleDragEnd(shape.id, e)}
              />
            );
          } else if (shape.type === 'circle') {
            return (
              <Circle
                key={shape.id}
                x={shape.x}
                y={shape.y}
                radius={shape.radius}
                fill={shape.fill}
                draggable
                onDragEnd={(e) => handleDragEnd(shape.id, e)}
              />
            );
          }
          return null;
        })}
      </Layer>
    </Stage>
  );
};
```

#### **4. Disable SSR for Konva**
You've already disabled SSR for `react-konva`, which is correct because `Konva` relies on the DOM. Ensure that `dynamic` imports are working correctly to prevent unnecessary reinitialization.

---

### **Debugging Tips**
- Add logging in the `handleDragEnd` function and React DevTools to confirm whether the entire canvas is being re-rendered.
- Use the React Profiler to identify which components are re-rendering unnecessarily.

---

### **Expected Outcome**
With these optimizations:
1. The `Stage` and `Layer` components will remain stable and won't be recreated.
2. Only the specific shape being dragged will update, minimizing re-renders.
3. The canvas flashing issue should disappear, and performance should improve.
