If you want to exclude the `class_color` column from the query and still achieve the desired effect, you can solely rely on dynamically assigning classes based on the `status` column value without directly referencing `class_color`. Here’s how to modify the solution:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Modify Your SQL Query**:
   Only include the `status` column and the dynamically assigned class column (`status_class`):

   ```sql
   SELECT status,
          CASE 
            WHEN status = 0 THEN 'status-red'
            WHEN status = 3 THEN 'status-green'
            WHEN status = 4 THEN 'status-blue'
          END AS status_class
   FROM your_table;
   ```

2. **Hide the `status` and `status_class` Columns**:
   In the Interactive Report attributes, set both the `status` and `status_class` columns to be hidden.

3. **Assign Dynamic Class Based on the `status_class`**:
   In your Interactive Report attributes, find the column you want to color (which previously might have been the `class_color` column). For this column:

   - In the "CSS Classes" field, enter: `#STATUS_CLASS#`

   This binds the `status_class` value from the SQL query to the relevant cells in this column.

4. **Add CSS Rules for Each Class**:
   Add the following CSS to your application’s inline CSS or a custom CSS file:

   ```css
   /* Apply the color styling using the class added by the SQL query */
   .status-red td {
       background-color: red;
   }

   .status-green td {
       background-color: green;
   }

   .status-blue td {
       background-color: blue;
   }
   ```

   **Note**: Adjust the CSS selectors if necessary to ensure they target only the cells in your chosen column.

### Explanation:
- The SQL query dynamically assigns a class to each row based on the `status` value.
- The report automatically assigns this class to the cells in the specified column using the `#STATUS_CLASS#` substitution string.
- CSS rules are then applied based on these classes, without needing to include the `class_color` column.

This method avoids JavaScript and still achieves your goal of dynamic styling based on the `status` column.
