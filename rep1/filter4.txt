Yes, using the described technique for filtering, you can apply filters step-by-step, such that each filter builds on the previous one. This approach will allow you to filter progressively, like setting a unit first and then filtering the results further by date ranges.

Hereâ€™s how it works step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Filtering Example:

1. **Set Initial Filter by Unit**:
   - Suppose you first set the `P1_UNIT` value to `1`. The Interactive Report query will filter the results based on this unit. The SQL query would include a filter condition like this:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM YOUR_VIEW
   WHERE (:P1_UNIT IS NULL OR unit_id = :P1_UNIT)
     AND (:P1_PLANING_START IS NULL OR planing_start >= TO_DATE(:P1_PLANING_START, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'))
     AND (:P1_PLANING_END IS NULL OR planing_end <= TO_DATE(:P1_PLANING_END, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'))
     AND (:P1_FACT_START IS NULL OR fact_start >= TO_DATE(:P1_FACT_START, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'))
     AND (:P1_FACT_END IS NULL OR fact_end <= TO_DATE(:P1_FACT_END, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'));
   ```

   In this query, if `P1_UNIT` is set to `1`, only records with `unit_id = 1` will be shown initially. 

2. **Add Date Filters Step-by-Step**:
   After setting the unit filter, you can proceed to set date filters using the date picker items (`P1_PLANING_START`, `P1_PLANING_END`, `P1_FACT_START`, and `P1_FACT_END`). As you set these date filters, the Interactive Report will update automatically due to the **Dynamic Actions** attached to these date picker items.

   - For example, if you then set `P1_FACT_START` to a specific date, the report will filter for all records from `fact_start` greater than or equal to that date and still respect the previously set unit filter (`unit_id = 1`).

### Benefits of Step-by-Step Filtering:

1. **Interactive Refinement**: Users can progressively refine the report by applying filters one-by-one. For instance, they can first filter by unit, then by date range, and so on.
2. **Dynamic Refresh**: By using Dynamic Actions on change events for each filter item, the Interactive Report updates automatically without needing to reload the entire page.
3. **Compound Filtering**: Each additional filter condition narrows down the dataset further based on previously applied filters.

### Recommendations for a Smooth Experience:

- **Order the Filters Logically**: Arrange the filter items in the sidebar in a logical order that reflects how users are likely to filter data (e.g., start with unit and department filters, then add date filters).
- **Use Conditional Display**: If needed, you can display date filters conditionally based on whether a unit is selected, improving the user experience.

### Example of the Complete SQL Query:
Your SQL query might look like this to accommodate all filters step-by-step:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM YOUR_VIEW
WHERE (:P1_UNIT IS NULL OR unit_id = :P1_UNIT)
  AND (:P1_DEPARTMENT IS NULL OR department_id = :P1_DEPARTMENT)
  AND (:P1_PLANING_START IS NULL OR planing_start >= TO_DATE(:P1_PLANING_START, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'))
  AND (:P1_PLANING_END IS NULL OR planing_end <= TO_DATE(:P1_PLANING_END, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'))
  AND (:P1_FACT_START IS NULL OR fact_start >= TO_DATE(:P1_FACT_START, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'))
  AND (:P1_FACT_END IS NULL OR fact_end <= TO_DATE(:P1_FACT_END, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'));
```

With this approach, filtering step-by-step becomes seamless and efficient, allowing users to gradually narrow down the results.
