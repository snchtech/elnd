To achieve this functionality in Oracle APEX, you can use the following steps:

### Steps:

1. **Set Up Shared Cookies Between Applications:**
   - Ensure that the two applications (with `APP_ID` 101 and 105) are using shared cookies. You’ve already mentioned this is set up, so no further action is needed here.

2. **Create the Button in Application 101:**
   - Add a button to your page in `APP_ID 101`. For example, create a button named `Open Modal`.

3. **Construct the URL for Navigation:**
   - Use the URL format to navigate to `APP_ID 105`, page 1, and trigger the modal page 3.

   The URL should look like this:

   ```
   f?p=105:1:&APP_SESSION.::::P3_REQUEST_TYPE:CREATE
   ```

   Here:
   - `105` is the target `APP_ID`.
   - `1` is the target main page.
   - `&APP_SESSION.` ensures the session is maintained.
   - `P3_REQUEST_TYPE` is an example item in the modal page to pass a value like `CREATE` to trigger a modal for creation.

4. **Configure the Modal Page in Application 105:**
   - In `APP_ID 105`, configure **Page 3** (your modal page):
     - **Source:** Check the value of `P3_REQUEST_TYPE` or similar item in the page.
     - **Modal Dialog Settings:** Ensure the modal page has the correct settings to open as a dialog.

5. **Add JavaScript to Automatically Open Modal:**
   - On **Page 1** of `APP_ID 105`, add this JavaScript in the `Page Attributes` -> `Execute when Page Loads` section:

     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function () {
         var requestType = $v('P3_REQUEST_TYPE'); // Replace with your actual page item.
         if (requestType === 'CREATE') {
             apex.navigation.dialog('f?p=105:3:&APP_SESSION.', {
                 title: "Create Record",
                 modal: true
             });
         }
     });
     ```

6. **Set Button Action in Application 101:**
   - In your `APP_ID 101` application, set the button’s action as `Redirect to URL` and use the constructed URL:

     ```
     f?p=105:1:&APP_SESSION.::::P3_REQUEST_TYPE:CREATE
     ```

7. **Test the Setup:**
   - Run your application in `APP_ID 101` and click the button. It should navigate to the main page of `APP_ID 105` and automatically open the modal window for page 3.

### Notes:
- Replace `P3_REQUEST_TYPE` with the actual page item that your modal page uses for determining the action (e.g., `CREATE`, `EDIT`).
- Ensure both applications share the same authentication scheme to maintain the session.
- If necessary, adjust security settings to allow navigation between apps.
