It looks like you're encountering an issue where Chrome is unable to change the default browser settings directly, and instead, it's redirecting you to the Windows **Settings** menu. This is a known issue with Windows 10 (and newer) where setting a default browser requires a manual process through the **Default Apps** settings in Windows.

Windows 10 has tightened security and user control over default app settings, so the process of changing the default browser through scripts or Chrome's settings is somewhat limited. However, here is the **manual process** you can follow to change the default browser to Google Chrome in Windows 10:

### Manual Steps to Set Google Chrome as the Default Browser in Windows 10:

1. **Open Windows Settings**:
   - Press `Windows Key + I` to open **Settings**.

2. **Go to Default Apps**:
   - In the **Settings** window, go to **Apps**.
   - On the left side, click **Default apps**.

3. **Set Chrome as the Default Browser**:
   - Scroll down to the section labeled **Web browser**.
   - If it shows another browser (like Edge), click on it, and you'll see a list of available browsers.
   - Select **Google Chrome** from the list.

This process requires manual interaction because Windows 10 and 11 require users to manually confirm default apps for important tasks, like web browsing, to prevent unwanted changes by software or scripts.

### Troubleshooting Chrome Settings:

If you are still having issues where Chrome is not appearing as an option, or clicking "Make Default" in Chrome's settings just opens the Windows **Settings** window without working, try the following:

1. **Ensure Chrome is Fully Updated**:
   - Go to Chrome’s **Settings** (three-dot menu at the top-right) → **Help** → **About Google Chrome**.
   - Make sure you are running the latest version of Google Chrome.

2. **Reinstall Google Chrome**:
   - Sometimes, reinstallation of Chrome can help resolve issues where Windows doesn’t recognize it as a valid option for the default browser.
   - First, uninstall Chrome through **Settings** → **Apps**.
   - Then, download and install the latest version of Chrome from the [Google Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

3. **Check for Windows Updates**:
   - Make sure your Windows system is up to date. Go to **Settings** → **Update & Security** → **Windows Update** and check for updates.
   - Sometimes, bugs or issues in older Windows versions can cause problems with changing default apps.

### Programmatic Approach for Enterprise:

In enterprise or managed environments, changing the default browser may require additional configuration through **Group Policy** or an enterprise management tool like **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**. You can control default app associations by pushing policies that set Google Chrome as the default browser across multiple systems.

### Group Policy Method (For Enterprise Management):

If you're in a domain environment or managing multiple PCs, you can also use Group Policy to enforce default application settings. This is more advanced and may require administrative privileges:

1. **Create an XML File for Default Associations**:
   - Create an XML file with the following content:
     ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <DefaultAssociations>
         <Association Identifier=".htm" ProgId="ChromeHTML" ApplicationName="Google Chrome" />
         <Association Identifier=".html" ProgId="ChromeHTML" ApplicationName="Google Chrome" />
         <Association Identifier="http" ProgId="ChromeHTML" ApplicationName="Google Chrome" />
         <Association Identifier="https" ProgId="ChromeHTML" ApplicationName="Google Chrome" />
     </DefaultAssociations>
     ```

2. **Deploy the XML via Group Policy**:
   - Open the **Group Policy Editor** on your domain controller.
   - Go to **Computer Configuration** → **Administrative Templates** → **Windows Components** → **File Explorer**.
   - Look for the policy **Set a default associations configuration file**.
   - Enable the policy and set the path to the XML file you created.

This will push Chrome as the default browser for all users under that policy.

### Summary:

- **Windows 10 and newer** require manual confirmation of default app settings through the **Settings** app.
- Programmatic changes to default browsers are restricted due to security measures.
- Follow the manual steps in **Settings** to set Chrome as the default.
- If managing multiple machines, consider using **Group Policy** or enterprise management tools to push default app associations.
