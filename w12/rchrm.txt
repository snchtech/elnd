To modify the default browser settings using only a `.cmd` or `.bat` file, without relying on PowerShell, you'll need to ensure that the script can be run with elevated permissions. Here's an example of how to write the script without PowerShell for Windows:

### Example `SetDefaultBrowser.cmd` (without PowerShell):

```cmd
@echo off
REM Check if running as administrator
openfiles >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo Please run this script as an administrator.
    exit /b
)

REM Set Google Chrome as the default browser for .html, http, and https protocols

REM Modify registry for .html files
REG ADD "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.html\UserChoice" /v ProgId /t REG_SZ /d ChromeHTML /f

REM Modify registry for HTTP protocol
REG ADD "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Associations\UrlAssociations\http\UserChoice" /v ProgId /t REG_SZ /d ChromeHTML /f

REM Modify registry for HTTPS protocol
REG ADD "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Associations\UrlAssociations\https\UserChoice" /v ProgId /t REG_SZ /d ChromeHTML /f

echo Default browser set to Google Chrome for the current user.
```

### Steps to Use:

1. **Create the Script**:
   - Copy the above code into a text file and save it with a `.cmd` or `.bat` extension, e.g., `SetDefaultBrowser.cmd`.

2. **Run the Script as Administrator**:
   - Right-click on the `.cmd` file and select **Run as Administrator** to ensure it has the necessary permissions to modify the registry.

3. **Ensure Chrome is Installed**:
   - This script assumes that Google Chrome is installed and its registry key is `ChromeHTML`. If Chrome is installed, this key should already exist.

### Alternative: Setting the Script to Run at Logon

If you want this script to run automatically for users when they log in, you can:

1. **Add the Script to the Startup Folder**:
   - Place the `.cmd` file in the user's **Startup** folder:
     ```
     C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
     ```
   - This ensures the script will run every time the user logs in.

2. **Using Group Policy** (for domain environments):
   - You can configure the script to run at logon via **Group Policy** if you're in an Active Directory environment:
     - Open `gpedit.msc` → **User Configuration** → **Windows Settings** → **Scripts (Logon/Logoff)**.
     - Add the `.cmd` file to the **Logon** script section.

### Important Notes:

- **Administrator Permissions**: This script will need administrator permissions to modify registry settings. It won’t work if it’s not run with elevated privileges.
- **Windows Version**: This approach works for Windows 10 and Windows 11, but older versions might require different registry paths or approaches.
- **Security**: Modifying user-level settings automatically can be sensitive in some environments, so ensure you have permission to do so in your organization.
